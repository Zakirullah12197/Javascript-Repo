# ðŸš€ JavaScript Objects Assignment

This repository contains **JavaScript practice code** focusing on **Objects** â€“ including **property freezing** and **dynamic key creation**.  
Itâ€™s part of my journey to becoming a **job-ready JavaScript developer**.

## ðŸ“‚ What's Inside?
- **ðŸ”’ Freeze Only One Property** â€“ Using `Object.defineProperty()` to make a single property immutable without freezing the whole object.
- **âš¡ Dynamic Keys** â€“ Creating object keys from variables using **computed property names**.

## ðŸ›  How to Run
Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.

```bash
node Code9.js
