# ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Assignment â€“ Loops & High-Order Array Iterations

## ðŸš€ Questions

---

### 1. Print Numbers (for loop)

Print numbers from **1 to 20** using a `for` loop.
Skip the number `13` using `continue`.

---

### 2. Multiplication Table (nested for)

Generate the multiplication table of `5` using a `for` loop.
Format: `5 x 1 = 5 â€¦ 5 x 10 = 50`.

---

### 3. Array Iteration (for loop)

Given:

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "mango"];
```

Print each fruit using a simple `for` loop.

---

### 4. Break Statement Example

Loop from `1 to 20`.
If the number is `10`, print `"Found 10, stopping loop"` and break.

---

### 5. While Loop Basics

Print numbers from **1 to 10** using a `while` loop.

---

### 6. Do-While Example

Take `score = 15`.
Use a `do...while` loop to print the score at least once, and stop when `score <= 10`.

---

### 7. for...of with Array

Given:

```js
let cities = ["Delhi", "Mumbai", "Paris", "New York"];
```

Use `for...of` to print each city.

---

### 8. for...of with String

Take a string: `"JavaScript"`.
Use `for...of` to print each character.

---

### 9. Map Iteration (for...of)

Create a `Map` with 3 countries and their capitals.
Iterate using `for...of` and print:
`India :- New Delhi`.

---

### 10. for...in with Object

Given:

```js
const student = {
  name: "Ali",
  age: 21,
  grade: "A"
};
```

Use `for...in` to print keys and values.

---

### 11. for...in with Array

Given:

```js
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
```

Use `for...in` to print the **index** and value.

---

### 12. forEach Basics

Given:

```js
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

Use `forEach` to print each color.

---

### 13. forEach with Index

On the same `colors` array, print each color with its index:
`0: red`, `1: green`, â€¦

---

### 14. Array of Objects (forEach)

Given:

```js
const users = [
  { name: "Ali", age: 25 },
  { name: "Sara", age: 22 },
  { name: "John", age: 30 }
];
```

Use `forEach` to print:
`Ali is 25 years old`, etc.

---

### 15. Filter Odd Numbers (forEach)

Given `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`, use `forEach` to print only odd numbers.

---

### 16. Nested Loop Pattern

Print the pattern using nested `for` loops:

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

---

### 17. Reverse Array (for loop)

Given:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

Print the array in reverse order using a `for` loop.

---

### 18. Sum of Array (for...of)

Given `[10, 20, 30, 40]`, use `for...of` to calculate and print the sum.

---

### 19. Character Count (for...of)

Take a string `"hello"`.
Use `for...of` to count how many characters it has.

---

### 20. Object of Arrays (for...in + forEach)

Given:

```js
const courses = {
  js: ["arrays", "objects", "loops"],
  py: ["functions", "modules"],
  java: ["OOP", "Collections"]
};
```

Use `for...in` to loop over keys and `forEach` to print topics in this format:

```
js: arrays, objects, loops
py: functions, modules
java: OOP, Collections
```
