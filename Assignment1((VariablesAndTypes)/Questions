Assignment 1: JavaScript Basics & Variables â€” designed to reinforce core JS fundamentals like variables, types, and simple operations.

ðŸ“˜ JavaScript Assignment 1: Variables, Data Types, and Basics
ðŸ”° Objective: Learn how to declare variables, use different data types, understand const and let, and work with basic console output.

ðŸ”¹ Q1. Declare Personal Info Variables
  Create the following variables with suitable data types:
  
  Full name (e.g., "Muhammad Zakirullah")
  
  Age (e.g., 21)
  
  Whether you're a student (e.g., true)
  
  Country name (e.g., "Pakistan")
  
  College name (e.g., "GPGC Nowshera")

ðŸ”¹ Q2. Print Data Types
Use typeof to print the data type of each variable you declared above.

ðŸ”¹ Q3. Try Reassigning a const Variable
Create a variable with const, then try to change its value. Wrap the code in try...catch to handle and print the error.

ðŸ”¹ Q4. Create an Undefined Variable
Declare a variable (e.g., futureGoal) without assigning any value. Print its value and type.

ðŸ”¹ Q5. Use Template Strings
Print a sentence like:

"Hi, I am Muhammad Zakirullah, 21 years old, from Pakistan."
Use template literals (backticks and ${}).

ðŸ”¹ Q6. Swap Two Variables
Swap the values of two variables a = 10 and b = 20 using a third variable, and print before and after values.

ðŸ”¹ Q7. Declare All 7 Primitive Data Types
Create one variable for each of the following types:

String

Number

Boolean

Undefined

Null

Symbol

BigInt

Print their values and types using console.log.

ðŸ”¹ Q8. Use let and Try Redeclaration
Declare a variable using let, then try to redeclare it in the same scope. Observe and explain the behavior (you may get an error â€” understand why).
